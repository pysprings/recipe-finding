Best Recipes
============

The code in this repo was what came out of the `August 25, 2015 PySprings meetup
<http://www.meetup.com/PySprings/events/224574554/>`_.

Two different approaches were taken:

  # Get into the details of various recipes and attempt to formulate metrics of
    the "best" recipe using those details (edamam.ipynb)

  # Use a simpler API that already provides a concept of ranking (food2fork.ipynb,
    bestrecipes.py)

In order to use this code, you will need an API key from one of two sites. Both
were available for no cost at the time the code was written:

  - `Edamam API <https://developer.edamam.com/>`_

  - `Food2Fork API <http://food2fork.com/about/api>`_
